## Project goal
To compare accuracy between one and two hidden layers

## Development Tools
PyTorch Framework

## Results & Conclusion
* 1 hidden layer: Iteration 6000. Loss: 0.06581279635429382. Accuracy: 97
* 2 hidden layers: Iteration 6000. Loss: 0.07550930976867676. Accuracy: 96
* 3 hidden layers: Iteration 5500. Loss: 0.041268497705459595. Accuracy: 97
##There is no much difference between 1 hidden layer, 2 hidden layers & 3 hidden layers.
